Instructions on how to compile/execute our code (given that the circuitry and hardware is all set up and all external libraries are downloaded):
1) Make sure there is an Rpi set up as a broker before starting anything.
2) On your PC, open up your terminal and cd into the directory that contains project_sub.py.
3) Open up a new terminal window and ssh into a different Rpi (that isn't the broker).
4) Open up a new terminal window and cd into the directory that contains project_pub.py.
5) Send the project_pub.py file to the Rpi you ssh-ed into (using scp, copy-paste, etc).
6) Run project_sub.py in its terminal.
7) Run project_pub.py on the Rpi. 
9) Watch our project work!

External Libraries used in our code:
